INSTRUCTIONS OF USE:

1- Compiling the sources:

The sc2v translator is based on lex and yacc tools. You need lex and yacc
installed before trying to compile sc2v.

For compiling the sources just type "make" under the directory you unzipped the
fonts. It will generate three executables: sc2v_step1 and sc2v_step2 sc2v_step3.


2- Translating an SystemC module:

The translation is done in two steps. First you must translate the .cpp file by
typing:	sc2v_step1 < file.cpp
Second step consists in traslating the .h file: sc2v_step2 < file.h > file.v

3- Format and restrictions of the SystemC files:
	
	- Each module must have a .h file with the declarations of ports,
	signals, and processes, and there must exist a .cpp file with the code
	of the processes.
	
	- For writing to a port or a signal you must ALWAYS use the .write()
	method.
	
	- You cannot use functions.
	
	-Macros with no parameters are supported, but may cause little problems
	with name of variables. Macros with parameters are not supported.
	
	-Only data types: bool, sc_int, sc_bigint, sc_uint and sc_biguint are
	supported.
	
	-No global variables supported.
	
4- Known bugs

	-The usage of macros and defines may cause some errors.
	
	-Using comments in switch case structures may cause errors. Specially
	when using structures like:
	
		case 1: //Comment here
		case 2:
		//Or comment here
		case 3:	
		
	Better write it like this:
	
		//Comment for 1, 2 and 3
		case 1:
		case 2:
		case 3:
			instructions . . .
			instructions . . .
			instructions . . .

	A general rule would be: "Don't use comments in the same line of case or
	in the inmediate next line. Use comments in the line before the case
	statement"

5- For testing the application we recommend to use the systemcdes or the
systemcmd5 cores, both available at www.opencores.org.

6- For any doubt, comment, or for reporting bugs, feel free to write to
sc2v@opensocdesign.com


TODO:

	- Repair all known bugs.
	- Make functions supported.
	- Make macros fully supported.
